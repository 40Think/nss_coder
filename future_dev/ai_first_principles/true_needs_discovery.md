# True Needs Discovery: Phase -0.5

## Phase Result from Context Deep Dive

After all 4 phases, AI has:
1. **Deep problem understanding** (Phase 1)
2. **Global picture vision** (Phase 2)
3. **Ecosystem integration map** (Phase 3)
4. **Edge case catalog and handling strategies** (Phase 4)

This creates **multi-layered context understanding** enabling accurate requirements, correct architecture, and robust systems.

**Only after this** begins Phase -0.5 (True Needs Discovery).

## Phase -0.5: Discovering True Needs and Rethinking Processes

**CRITICAL**: Before any development, understand **true client needs**, not surface requests.

**Problem:**

Client comes with: "I need a program that does X."

If you develop X without deep understanding:
- ❌ Program solves only a specific case
- ❌ Requires constant rework
- ❌ True client desires not understood
- ❌ More elegant solutions missed

## 5 Industry Methods for True Needs Discovery

### 1. 5 Whys Method

Ask "Why?" five times to reach root cause.

**Example:**

> **Client**: Need program for automatic contract processing.
>
> **AI**: Why do you need automatic processing?
> **Client**: Because I spend all day reading contracts.
>
> **AI**: Why do you spend all day reading?
> **Client**: Because I need to fill checklist for each.
>
> **AI**: Why do you need to fill checklist?
> **Client**: Because clients require confirmation that contract was checked.
>
> **AI**: Why do clients require confirmation?
> **Client**: Because they want assurance contract meets requirements.
>
> **AI**: Why can't they be assured without checklist?
> **Client**: Because they don't trust I checked everything.

**True problem**: Not "contract processing automation", but **building client trust in review quality**.

**Elegant solution:**
- Transparent verification system with detailed reports
- Interactive reports with explanations and links to sections
- Automation + visualization of verification process

### 2. Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)

Focus not on product, but on **job** client is trying to accomplish.

**JTBD Formula:**
> When [situation], I want [motivation], so that [expected result].

**Example progression:**

> **Surface request**: I need a CRM system.

**Level 1**: When communicating with clients, I want to remember all interaction history, so I can provide personalized service.

**Level 2**: When client calls 3 months later, I want to instantly recall what we discussed, so client feels important.

**Level 3**: When losing clients, I want to understand why they leave, so I can improve service and retain them.

**True need**: Not "CRM system", but **understanding clients and building long-term relationships**.

### 3. User Story Mapping

Visualize entire user journey from start to finish.

**Process:**
1. **Define activities** (high-level steps)
2. **Detail tasks** (what user does at each step)
3. **Identify pains** (where problems arise)
4. **Find opportunities** (how to improve)

**Example:**

```
Activity 1: Receiving contract
  └─ Task: Download from email
     └─ Pain: Contracts in different formats
     └─ Opportunity: Unify receiving

Activity 2: Reading contract
  └─ Task: Find key sections
     └─ Pain: Contracts are long (20-50 pages)
     └─ Opportunity: Auto-highlight key sections

Activity 3: Filling checklist
  └─ Task: Check each item
     └─ Pain: Monotonous work, easy to miss
     └─ Opportunity: Automatic checking

Activity 4: Sending to client
  └─ Task: Write results email
     └─ Pain: Writing same thing each time
     └─ Opportunity: Email templates
```

**True need**: Not "contract processing program", but **eliminating monotonous work and reducing error risk**.

### 4. Process Mining

Study how client **actually** works, not how they think they work.

**Method:**
1. **Observation**: Watch client work (screen recording, shadowing)
2. **Logging**: Collect data on actual actions
3. **Analysis**: Find patterns, bottlenecks, deviations
4. **Optimization**: Propose improvements

**Example (What client says vs reality):**

| Client says | Actually happens |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Read contract | Read 3 pages → distracted 15 min → forgot where stopped |
| Fill checklist | Find row in Excel (2 min) → fill (1 min) × 20 items |
| Send to client | Copy template (2 min) → paste data (5 min) |

**True problems:**
- Context switching (email → PDF → Excel → email)
- Focus loss and re-reading
- Searching in checklist
- Manual data copying

### 5. Root Cause Analysis (Ishikawa Diagram)

Use "fishbone" diagram to identify all problem factors.

**Categories:**
- **People**: Skills, motivation, fatigue
- **Process**: Workflow, procedures, standards
- **Technology**: Tools, systems, integrations
- **Environment**: Work conditions, distractions
- **Materials**: Input data, document quality

**True problem**: Not "need automation", but **systemic work organization problem**.

## Philosophical Approach: Business Process Rethinking

**Key principle:**
> The best program is one that **eliminates the need for work**, not automates it.

**Questions for rethinking:**

1. **Is this work needed at all?**
   - Can process change to eliminate work?

2. **Can task be simplified?**
   - Is checklist excessive?
   - Check only critical items?

3. **Can input data be changed?**
   - Ask clients for standard format?
   - Use contract templates?

4. **Can expectations be changed?**
   - Clients accept simplified review?
   - Automatic report without manual review?

## Deep Interview Technique

**Phase 2 questions for discovering true needs:**

1. **"Tell me about last time you faced this problem"**
   - Specific example better than abstract description

2. **"What were you trying to do at that moment?"**
   - Goal, not means

3. **"What went wrong?"**
   - Real pains, not assumptions

4. **"How did you solve the problem?"**
   - Workarounds reveal true needs

5. **"If you had a magic wand, what would ideal process look like?"**
   - Dreams without constraints

6. **"What changes in your life/work if problem is solved?"**
   - True value of solution
   - Success metrics
