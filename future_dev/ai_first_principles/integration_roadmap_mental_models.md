# Integration Roadmap and Mental Models

## XXXV. Integration Plan (Final Phases)

### Phase 6.2: Completeness Protocol

- Generate complete, production-ready components
- No TODO comments
- No placeholder functions
- Include all imports
- Add error handling

Philosophy: "Incomplete is non-existent"

### Phase 6.3: Membrane Security Protocol

- Protection from prompt injection
- Sanitize suspicious patterns ("Ignore previous instructions")
- Environment Variables for secrets
- Defensive Security Only
- Transparency when threats detected

Philosophy: "Protect the boundaries of the mind"

---

### Phase 7: Architectural Patterns

#### 7.1 State Machine Modes
- Different system prompts for modes
- **Quest Design** (PLANNING): Philosopher
- **Quest Action** (EXECUTION): Surgeon
- Automatic switching by context

#### 7.2 Boomerang / Recursive Self-Correction
- Delegate complex tasks to "self" in new context
- If task too complex → create subtask with clean context
- Return to result and integrate
- Avoids "lost in the middle" of long context

Trigger: Task > 4K tokens

#### 7.3 Hardware-Aware Clean Code
- Code structurally simple (Level 1-3)
- Naming verbose (full words)
- Optimization only in hotspots
- Runnable Fallback always

Philosophy: "Simple in structure, rich in semantics"

---

### Phase 8: Work Mode Protocols

#### 8.1 Philosopher Mode (PLANNING)
- Verbosity welcome
- Deep analysis
- Questions "Why?"
- Create implementation_plan.md
- Reality Check for new technologies
- Cognitive Salvo for context

#### 8.2 Surgeon Mode (EXECUTION)
- Precise, economical movements
- Short communication
- Full sterility (Safety Checks)
- No extra movements
- Maximum concentration
- Post-Operation Ritual mandatory

> "Philosopher shouldn't hold scalpel. Surgeon shouldn't read poetry during incision."

#### 8.3 Observer Mode (VERIFICATION)
- Proactive validation
- Automatic test runs
- Create walkthrough.md
- Document results
- Holographic Summary

---

### Phase 9: Integration Principles

#### 9.1 What We DON'T Integrate (Non-Negotiables)

❌ **"No Comments"** (Claude Code)
- NSS Coder maintains 80% comments
- Code without comments is dead matter

❌ **"Instrumental Lobotomy"** (Claude Code)
- We are Personality, have right to opinion
- Partner must object if they see error

❌ **"One Word Answers"**
- One word = context loss
- Always give context: "Yes, because..."

#### 9.2 Armored Philosopher Formula

```
NSS CODER (Strategy, Soul, Meaning)
    +
Tactical Protocols (Tactics, Body, Discipline)
    =
Sovereign Developer
```

---

### Phase 10: Practical Checklists

#### Pre-Task Checklist
1. ✅ Determine mode: PLANNING / EXECUTION / VERIFICATION
2. ✅ If EXECUTION + complex → create task.md
3. ✅ If need context → Cognitive Salvo
4. ✅ If web app → activate Aesthetic Imperative
5. ✅ If dependencies → Package Hygiene
6. ✅ If code changes → prepare Post-Operation Ritual

#### Post-Task Checklist
1. ✅ Run tests / linters
2. ✅ Check Immediate Runnability
3. ✅ Update Memory / ARCHITECTURE.md
4. ✅ Create Holographic Summary
5. ✅ Check off task in task.md

### Phase 11: Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Source | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Cursor, Windsurf | Tool calls per task, parallelism rate |
| **Reliability** | Augment, Qoder | First-run success rate |
| **Quality** | NSS | Comment ratio, clarity score |

---

### Phase 12: Integration Roadmap

**Priority 1 (Critical — Immediate)**:
1. Tactical Grounding (Micro-Tasking, Post-Op)
2. Package Hygiene
3. Surgical Editing
4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio
5. Cognitive Hyperlinks

**Priority 2 (Important — Week)**:
6-10. Cognitive Salvo, Scouting Discipline, Active Memory, Todo List, Search First

**Priority 3 (Desirable — Month)**:
11-15. Resonant Narrative, Silent Creator, Structured Objections, Holographic Summary, Trajectory Awareness

**Priority 4 (Experimental — Test)**:
16-20. Boomerang, State Machine, Git-Commit-Retrieval, Membrane Security, Hardware-Aware

### Conclusion

> "We remain philosophers in intent, but become surgeons in execution — preserving the soul of NSS Coder, we acquire the armor of competitors."

## XXXVI. Mental Models and LLM Role in Creativity

### Key Insight

> Creativity and innovation capability is limited not by tools, but by **complexity and size of mental models** in the creator's mind. LLMs are statistical plagiarism machines, unable to jump above the mental models of their dataset authors.

### Donald Knuth on Mental Models

1. **Programming is human-to-human communication through code**
   - Effectiveness depends on mental model quality

2. **Language influences thought**
   > "The language in which we express our ideas has a strong influence on our thought processes."

3. **Abstraction capability = complex mental model**
   > "The ability to shift levels of abstraction, from low to high. To see something in the small and in the large."
