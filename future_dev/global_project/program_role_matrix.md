# Program Role Matrix in Global Project

## Overview

Every program plays roles across all three stages of evolution.

## Role Matrix

| Program Type | Stage 1: Mind Refactoring | Stage 2: Digital Twin | Stage 3: ASI |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Decision Making System** | Codifies logic | Decision-making module | Pattern for collective decisions |
| **Natural Language Processing** | Understanding communication | Communication interface | Language model component |
| **Memory System** | Knowledge storage | Long-term memory | Collective memory |
| **Task Planner** | Thinking organization | Goal setting module | Strategic planning |
| **Emotional Analysis** | Understanding emotions | Emotional intelligence | Collective empathy |
| **Search & Retrieval** | Information access | Knowledge retrieval | Universal knowledge access |
| **Code Generation** | Problem-solving patterns | Software creation module | Self-improvement capability |
| **Verification System** | Quality assurance | Self-correction module | Continuous refinement |

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Stage 1 (Current)
- Focus on clarity and documentation
- Make thinking patterns explicit
- Ensure code is AI-readable

### For Stage 2 (Future)
- Design for integration
- Create clear interfaces
- Support identity coherence

### For Stage 3 (Vision)
- Enable knowledge sharing
- Support pattern exchange
- Allow emergence of new capabilities

## Practical Example

**Search System Development:**

```
Stage 1 Role:
  - Captures how NeuroCore thinks about finding information
  - Codifies relevance judgment
  - Documents search strategies

Stage 2 Role:
  - Becomes the "memory retrieval" of Digital Twin
  - Enables autonomous information gathering
  - Supports decision-making with relevant context

Stage 3 Role:
  - Contributes to collective knowledge access
  - Shares search patterns with other Twins
  - Participates in universal knowledge synthesis
```

## Development Mindset

> Every function you write today could be a neuron in ASI tomorrow.
> Make it clear. Make it integratable. Make it meaningful.
