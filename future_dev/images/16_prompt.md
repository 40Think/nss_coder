**Image Prompt Concept:** "From Chaos to Flow: The Scientific Taylorism of Code"

**Visual Structure:**
A split-screen composition demonstrating the evolution from "Manual/Copilot" chaos to "NSS Factory" order.

**Left Side (30%): "The Bottleneck Paradox"**
*   **Scene:** Darker, slightly claustrophobic coding environment.
*   **Subject:** A senior developer looking exhausted/stressed, hand on forehead.
*   **Screen Content:** Chaotic mix of code, red error squiggles, and a spinning "Loading/Generating" wheel (symbolizing Latency).
*   **Atmosphere:** Information overload. Ghostly, disorganized puzzle pieces floating around (Mental Model mismatch).
*   **Caption/Label (Optional in style):** "The Verification Tax"

**Right Side (70%): "The Taylorist Assembly Line"**
*   **Scene:** A bright, expansive, futuristic factory floor with clean lines and "Apple-store" aesthetics.
*   **Mechanism:** A sleek conveyor belt moving translucent blue cubes (Atomic Code Units).
*   **Action:** Robotic precision arms labeled "TEST" and "SPEC" efficiently stamping the cubes with glowing green "VERIFIED" seals. No latency, just flow.
*   **Subject:** The same developer, but now standing on a "Supervisor Balcony," looking calm and commanding, orchestrating the system rather than typing.
*   **Atmosphere:** Flow state, speed, precision.
*   **Caption/Label (Optional in style):** "Zero-Latency Flow"

**Style Parameters:**
*   **Aesthetic:** High-end Technical Illustration meets Solar-Punk.
*   **Lighting:** Cinematic, contrasting the "blue-screen fatigue" of the left with the "warm, natural light + neon accents" of the right.
*   **Perspective:** Isometric or Wide-Angle cinematic shot.
*   **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5 render style, 8k resolution, highly detailed.
