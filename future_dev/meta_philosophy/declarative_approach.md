# Declarative Approach Instead of Imperative

## Core Principle

We abandon rigid imperative rules and transition to **declarative description in the form of thought streams**.

## Implementation

### In System Prompts
- Describe philosophy and intentions, not rigid commands
- Focus on "why" and "what", not "how exactly"

### In Development Process
- Conduct dialogue as a stream of consciousness, not a list of instructions
- Allow ideas to flow naturally between human and AI

### Code Emergence
- Code emerges as a consequence of understanding
- Not as execution of an order, but as natural output of shared thinking

## Practical Guidelines

✅ **Do:**
- Express intentions clearly
- Share context and background
- Allow flexibility in implementation

❌ **Don't:**
- Issue rigid step-by-step commands
- Micromanage every decision
- Treat AI as a simple executor

## Example

**Imperative (avoid):**
```
Step 1: Create file search.py
Step 2: Add function search()
Step 3: Implement using Elasticsearch
```

**Declarative (preferred):**
```
We need a search capability that fits our RAG architecture.
The system should find relevant documents quickly while
maintaining our philosophy of owning our core components.
Let's think through the best approach together.
```
